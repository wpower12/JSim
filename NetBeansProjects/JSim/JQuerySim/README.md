# JSim
Elementary physics simulation using Javascript.  Collision detection and resolution, spatial partitioning data structure.

A running example can be found here: https://jsfiddle.net/9greLz70/

Collision resolution follows the examples given in this great tutorial: http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131424/pool_hall_lessons_fast_accurate_.php

I tried to keep my naming conventions the same as the articles, with a simialar code layout.  The global function
resolveCollision(b1, b2) contains the implementation.
